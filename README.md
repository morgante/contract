# Personal Contract

This is a personal contract between Morgante Pell ("I" or "me") and the world ("Life"). It is not legally enforcable, but includes built-in accountability mechanisms.

## Moral Philosophy

Life has imbued me with substantial compensation for engaging in this contract. In addition to the basic gift of existence, I have received numerous advantages which put me in the 99th percentile of priviledge worldwide. As a white American male of above average intelligence, merely surviving Life has never been in doubt. Thus, in exchange for this tremendous gift, I believe I have an obligation to Life to improve the net utility of humanity.

While there are many debates about what improving net human utility means, there is plenty of low-hanging fruit of utility improvement that debating the *direction* of improvement is not challenging. In particular, directed effort towards alleviating material deprivation has a tremendous ROI and therefore I align myself heavily with the [Effective Altruism](https://www.effectivealtruism.org/) movement.

What is more challenging than determining the direction of utility improvement is determing the appropriate velocity. I know how to do good, but how much good does this implicit contract bind me to do? One answer is that *any* positive net contribution to humanity is sufficient to fulfill my obligations as at the margin humanity is better off with me existing. This sets an absolute minimum for my net contribution (one which I have thus far struggled to clear).

Another comparison could be through a BATNA framework: if Life had conferred the same advantages on another person, how much net positive value would they generate for humanity? While this is generally a fairly low bar (most people are primarily absorbed in their lives and don't worry about improving humanity at all) I believe it's an important one to keep in mind. In particular, when it comes to the net value I create for those in my immediate [personal life](#personal-life). At a minimum, I should strive to be a better contributor to the lives of those around me than another random human would be.

The final metric could be to try to do the absolute most amount of good possible. This is a lofty goal and is likely unachievable for the vast majority of humans (including myself) who require some aspect of their effort to be translated into personal utility. However, it is still the target which I shoot for, especially when it comes to my long-term [philanthropy](./philanthropy.md).

## Personal Life
Given the moral terms of this contract, it is not immediately obvious that any commitments besides the [philanthropic](./philanthropy.md) clauses should be necessary. However, the truth is that as much as I aspire to be a philanthropy-generating [robot](#embracing-the-robot), I am still human and have normal human desires. That being said, I feel the need to justify expenditure on myself in terms of its service to this contract's mission.

To do so, it is important to recognize that the primary value I produce is dollars which can be transferred to effective altruism organizations. The primary way I produce those dollars is through my intellectual labor, which means anything which can improve my productivity and life span is valuable for the mission.

My anecdotal experience shows that trying to only work and sleep yields diminishing returns. While I can sustain this lifestyle for periods, it eventually leads to diminished productivity as my reserve of happiness decreases. Additionally, my work requires me to interact with other humans and if I do not dedicate some resources to self-care my interactions with other humans can be so negative as to weigh out the positive value of my philanthrophic contributions. Hence, it is integral to put some resources towards my personal happiness in order to sustain my productivity and not lower the utility of my professional colleagues.

Additionally, as my labor is my primary means of generating value, extending my life span has a tremendous ROI for humanity's utility. Conservatively speaking, under the terms of my [philanthropic commitments](./philanthropy.md), every year of productive work I add provides an additional $50,000 2017 dollars towards improving humanity. As such, most of the personal commitments in this contract aim to improve the length of my lifespan while ensuring I also provide value for those around me. In particular, [sustaining friendships](http://www.livescience.com/6769-live-longer-friends.html) and [finding a romantic partner](http://www.health.harvard.edu/newsletter_article/marriage-and-mens-health) are both scientifically validated factors in longevity, hence them forming the basis of my [social commitments](./social.md). Of course, most of my [health commitments](./health.md) are also designed to improve longevity.

## Embracing the Robot

While this contract might seem excessively strict and robotic to most people, the truth is that I make a terrible human but a pretty decent robot. Without prior commitments and left completely to my own devices, I typically revert to a lifestyle of only eating, sleeping, working, and readingâ€”a lifestyle which is unsustainable in the long run. However, I respond very well to incentives and commitment frameworks. Hence, this contract is an attempt to program healthier behavior into my life and to codify my personal expectations.

In addition, when designing clauses I place a heavy emphasis on reducing decision-making. Doing the right thing is often hard enough, but this can be especially challenging when compounded by the mental effort of deciding what the right thing is. Hence, this contract is designed as a way for me to live my life while minimizing the mental load of daily decisions.

The primary mechanism for enforcing this contract is through fines for non-compliance. Evert clause of this contract includes specified individuals ("Judges") who are responsible for judging compliace with that clause and enforcing fees for non-compliance. Fines are paid to Judges unless otherwise noted.

## Term

This contract goes into effect on May 29, 2017. Any changes to it go into effect 12 hours after they are merged into the master branch. I shall decide what changes are merged and can merge changes to remove clauses if I so desire.
