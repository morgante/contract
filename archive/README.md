## Archived clauses

I previously spent a lot of time on designing various incentive mechanisms to bind myself.
I have since abandoned most of them, but they are preserved here for posterity.

## Incentive Mechanisms

The primary audience for this contract is myself. It is an attempt to reduce the cognitive load of short-term decision-making by allowing me to pre-code certain decisions.

Thus, when designing clauses I place a heavy emphasis on reducing decision-making. Doing the right thing is often hard enough, but this can be especially challenging when compounded by the mental effort of deciding what the right thing is. Hence, this contract is designed as a way for me to live my life while minimizing the mental load of daily decisions.

I have historically tried various incentive mechanisms (ex. fines for non-compliance), but in practice those mechanisms were [quickly abandoned](https://github.com/morgante/contract/commit/2f417d53fbb7b4e3bf748cdb8955ba39e87ea441). Therefore, a secondary focus is on *accuracy*. This contract is not meant to be excessively aspirationalâ€”it is meant to dictate how I should act *today*, not how a hypothetical future (improved) Morgante should act in the future.

## Term

This contract went into effect on June 6, 2017. Any changes to it go into effect 12 hours after they are merged into the master branch. I shall decide what changes are merged and can merge changes to remove clauses if I so desire.
