# Health Commitments

Improving my physical health is critical to extending my longevity and also factors heavily productivity/happiness.

## Diet

I do not currently have an active diet plan.

I [previously](https://github.com/morgante/contract/blob/2017/health.md#diet) followed the keto diet effectively for 8 months and lost 60 pounds.

## Cardio

I must engage in at least 15 minutes of cardio exercise per day.
