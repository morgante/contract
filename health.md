# Health Commitments

Improving my physical health is critical to extending my longevity and also factors heavily productivity/happiness.

## Diet

Do not eat more than 24 grams of net carbs per day.

- Notes
    - Net carbs are carbohydrates minus fiber.
    - The [ketogenic diet](https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/) has already improved my health tremendously.
- Evidence
    - If I break this, I will tell the Judge.
- Fine: $100 for each day
- Judge: Jason Marmon

## ~~Cardio~~

**This clause is suspended while I recover from an injury.**

~~Engage in at least 15 minutes of cardio exercise per day.~~

- Notes
    - This must elevate my heart rate.
    - Only relatively "intense" exercise which produces a sweat counts.
- Evidence
    - A photo of an exercise machine or activity tracker is sufficient.
- Fine: $50 for each day
- Judge: Juan Felipe Beltr√°n
