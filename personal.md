# Personal Clauses

These clauses are focused on how I live my mental life and keep myself happy.

## Daily Reflections

I need to write a daily reflection. This can be short (even 1 word), but it must be written down.

I can write the reflection the following day, but delays of longer than 24 hours will be fined $10.
