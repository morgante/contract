# Philanthropic Commitments

As improving the net utility of humanity is my primary goal, donating to effective altruism organizations is critical to this contract. These terms will likely evolve over time as my wealth level changes.

## Monthly Donations

Every month I will donate 2% of my income for that month to my donor-advised Fund.

For efficiency purposes, the actual donation can happen less frequently so long as I reconcile it later in my spreadsheet.

## Bequeath

When I die, everything I own (except for $50,000 for my parents), will be given to the Against Malaria Foundation.

- Notes
    - $25,000 should be taken off the top and given to my dad.
    - Another $25,000 should be given to my mother.
    - Everything left over should be liquidated and donated to the AMF in the most effective way possible.
