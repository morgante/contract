# Philanthropic Commitments

As improving the net utility of humanity is my primary goal, donating to effective altruism organizations is critical to this contract. These terms will likely evolve over time as my wealth level changes.

## Monthly Donations

Every month I will donate 2% of my income for that month to an effective altruism charity of my choice.

- Notes
    - Charities must be approved by [GiveWell](http://www.givewell.org/charities/top-charities).
    - Any donations to non-EA organizations do not count towards this amount.
    - Monthly income is calculated from Mint.
- Evidence
    - A screenshot of Mint's monthly income statement proves income for that month.
    - Email receipts from charities prove contributions.
- Fine: if I have not donated the requisite amount, I must donate 3%.
- Judge: nominations open

## Bequeath

When I die, everything I own except for $50,000 for my parents, will be given to the Against Malaria Foundation.

- Notes
    - $25,000 should be taken off the top and given to my dad.
    - Another $25,000 should be given to my mother.
    - Everything left over should be liquidated and donated to the AMF in the most effective way possible.
- Evidence
    - I will create a will to enforce this.
- Fine: if I have not created a will for this by July 15, 2017 then I must donate $5,000 to the Against Malaria Foundation.
- Judge: nominations open
