# Social Commitments

Despite being aimed towards others, these commitments are the most selfish ones in the contract. Their primary purpose is to sustain my happiness and will to live, while ensuring I can also create positive value for those around me. It is particularly important for me to focus on creating positive value as in the past I have been a negative net influence on those around me.

## Socialize

I need to talk to at least one person every day.

- Notes
    - This must be in person, not online.
    - This cannot be a purely professional or transactional conversation, though it *can* start in that context.
- Fine: $10 for every day which I don't talk to someone
- Judge: Juan Felipe Beltrán

## Honesty

Do not deceive others.

- Notes
    - Creating false impressions without explicitly lying is still deceptive.
- Evidence
    - If I do this, I will admit it to the Judge.
- Fine: $5 to $1,000 depending on the self-assessed severity of the lie.
- Judge: Juan Felipe Beltrán

## Authenticity

Never do something which you would not admit to Daniel Brown.

- Notes
    - I believe in living my life openly, but realize there are some things I'm okay with doing which I would not publicly speak about.
    - Daniel is my most accepting friend, so if I do something I couldn't tell him it is truly unacceptable.
- Evidence
    - If I do it, I will Venmo Dan without having to explain what I did.
- Fine: $500
- Judge: Daniel Brown

## Social Expansion

Do something with someone new every week.

- Notes
    - This aims to expand my social circle and to build new relationships (with friends *or* potential romantic partners).
    - It can be with an existing connection but must be the first time we explicitly do something together that is not incidental to our professional/social interactions.
- Evidence
    - Evidence must be kept in a journal.
- Fine: $250
- Judge: Steve Dean
