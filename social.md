# Social Commitments

Despite being aimed towards others, these commitments are the most selfish ones in the contract. Their primary purpose is to sustain my happiness and will to live, while ensuring I can also create positive value for those around me. It is particularly important for me to focus on creating positive value as in the past I have been a negative net influence on those around me.

## Socialize

I need to talk to at least one person every day.

- Notes
    - This must be in person, not online.
    - This cannot be a purely professional or transactional conversation, though it *can* start in that context.
- Evidence
    - I will log this interaction into my notebook.
- Fine: $10 for every day which I don't talk to someone
- Judge: nominations open

## Honesty

Do not deceive others.

- Notes
    - Creating false impressions without explicitly lying is still deceptive.
- Evidence
    - If I do this, I will admit it to the Judge.
- Fine: $5 to $1,000 depending on the self-assessed severity of the lie.
- Judge: nominations open

## Authenticity

Never do something which you would not admit to Daniel Brown.

- Notes
    - I believe in living my life openly, but realize there are some things I'm okay with doing which I would not publicly speak about.
    - Daniel is my most accepting friend, so if I do something I couldn't tell him it is truly unacceptable.
- Evidence
    - If I do it, I will Venmo Dan without having to explain what I did.
- Fine: $500
- Judge: Daniel Brown?

## Romance

Express romantic interest in at least three women per week.

- Notes
    - Finding a romantic partner is likely one of the best ways to solidify my social life.
    - If I don't push myself to try, I likely will not.
    - This can include online messages.
- Evidence
    - Evidence must be presented to the Judge in the form of screenshots or an explanation.
- Fine: $250
- Judge: Ben Yu?
