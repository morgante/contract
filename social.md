# Social Commitments

Despite being aimed towards others, these commitments are the most selfish ones in the contract. Their primary purpose is to sustain my happiness and will to live, while ensuring I can also create positive value for those around me. It is particularly important for me to focus on creating positive value as in the past I have been a negative net influence on those around me.

## Socialize

I need to talk to at least one person every day.

- Notes
    - This must be in person, not online.
    - This cannot be a purely professional or transactional conversation, though it *can* start in that context.
- Evidence
    - I will log this interaction into my notebook.
- Fine: $10 for every day which I don't talk to someone
- Judge: Juan Felipe Beltrán

## Honesty

Do not deceive others.

- Notes
    - Creating false impressions without explicitly lying is still deceptive.
- Evidence
    - If I do this, I will admit it to the Judge.
- Fine: $5 to $1,000 depending on the self-assessed severity of the lie.
- Judge: Juan Felipe Beltrán

## Authenticity

Never do something which you would not admit to Daniel Brown.

- Notes
    - I believe in living my life openly, but realize there are some things I'm okay with doing which I would not publicly speak about.
    - Daniel is my most accepting friend, so if I do something I couldn't tell him it is truly unacceptable.
- Evidence
    - If I do it, I will Venmo Dan without having to explain what I did.
- Fine: $500
- Judge: Daniel Brown

## Kindness

Be kind to those around you and never be mean.

- Notes
    - These terms are very vague, but I usually know when I have been mean.
    - Defining kindness is more challenging and requires a robuster explanation.
    - Ideally this would trend towards greater empathy, but I am too weak in that area to even define it more clearly.
- Evidence
    - I will keep a journal of any unkind interactions
    - In this journal, I will log what an alternative *kinder* behavior would have been.
- Fine: $10 to $1000, based on the size of the gap between the unkind behavior and the kinder alternative.
- Judge: nominations open
